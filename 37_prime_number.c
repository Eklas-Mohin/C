/*
    Prime Number :
    A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number 
    which has exactly 2 factors.

    Factor :
    A number or algebric expression that divides 
    another number or expression evenlyâ€”i.e., with no remainder.

    The numbers which are not prime is called composite number.
    By definition 1 is neither prime nor prime.

    1 is not a prime number because it can not be divided by any
    other integer except for 1 and itself. The only factor of 1 is 1.
    On the other hand, 1 is also not a composite number because it 
    can not be divided by any other integer except for 1 and itself. 
    In conclusion, the number 1 is neither prime nor composite.
